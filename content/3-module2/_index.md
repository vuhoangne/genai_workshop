# Use Foundation Models in Amazon Bedrock

## 📌 Overview

[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing **foundation models (FMs)** from leading AI companies like Stability AI, Anthropic, and Meta, via a single API. It also provides the capabilities you need to build **Generative AI applications** with a focus on:
- 🔐 **Security**
- 🔏 **Privacy**
- 🤖 **Responsible AI**

Because Amazon Bedrock is **serverless**, you don’t need to manage infrastructure. You can securely integrate and deploy Generative AI into your applications using familiar AWS services.
