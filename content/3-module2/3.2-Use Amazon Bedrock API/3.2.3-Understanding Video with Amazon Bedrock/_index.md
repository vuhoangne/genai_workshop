In this section, we'll learn how to leverage [Amazon Nova](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/) for video content analysis and understanding.

---

### 🧪 Exercise 1: Understanding Video

In this exercise, we’ll explore how to use Amazon Nova’s understanding models to analyze video content. Imagine you're building a **content management system** that automatically generates engaging titles for video content. This could be useful for:

- A media company processing large volumes of videos  
- A marketing team organizing video assets  
- An e-learning platform cataloging educational videos  

We’ll create a script that analyzes an [MP4 file](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/artifacts/AWSNews/2024/AWSNEWS-1259-nova-pro-input-video.mp4?_=1) of the sea and uses Nova’s advanced understanding capabilities to generate **creative and relevant titles** based on the video's content. This demonstrates Nova’s ability to comprehend complex visual information and generate human-like text.

---

### 🚀 Getting Started

Open the file:

```plaintext
video_examples/video_understanding.py
```

This file already contains code to ingest video and send requests to Amazon Nova. However, it is **missing the correct data formatting** to send the video to Amazon Bedrock.

This is where you can use **Amazon Q Developer** to make a quick inline edit to complete the missing functionality.

---

### 💡 Using Amazon Q Developer for Inline Editing

To complete the video formatting functionality:

1. Highlight the `encode_video_to_base64` function on line 17  
2. Press `⌘ + I` on Mac or `Ctrl + I` on Windows  
3. Type the following prompt:

```plaintext
Finish the TODO and return the correct data
```

### ▶️ Running Your Code

Once you're ready to test your script:

```bash
cd video_examples
python3 video_understanding.py
```

If successful, you’ll see **generated titles for your video**.

If you encounter errors, use **Amazon Q Developer** to help debug the issues.

### 🔍 Exploring Nova's Capabilities

Once the basic implementation works, try experimenting with different prompts to explore Nova’s power:

- Generate **detailed video summaries** for content cataloging  
- Create **engaging descriptions** for social media  
- Produce **scene-by-scene analysis** for video editing  
- Extract **key moments or highlights** for quick previews  
- Generate **content tags** for improved searchability  

These use cases show how Nova can be integrated into various **content workflows and automation scenarios**.
