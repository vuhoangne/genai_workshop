Amazon Bedrock Playground provides a quick way to experiment with different foundation models inside the AWS Console. You can compare model outputs, load example prompts, and even export API requests. The following modes are supported:

💬 [Chat/Text](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/chat-playground): Experiment with a variety of language processing tasks in a step-by-step interface.  
🖼️ [Image/Video](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/image-generation-playground): Easily generate compelling images/videos by providing text prompts to pre-trained models.

📍 You can access the playground from the links above or from the [Amazon Bedrock Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/overview) via the **Playgrounds** menu on the left. Take a few minutes to try out some examples.
