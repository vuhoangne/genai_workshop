Before diving into the RAG workflow, it's important to understand **embeddings**. Embeddings represent documents as vectors in a multi-dimensional space. These vectors capture the essence of the content in a format that machines can process. By converting text into embeddings, we enable computers to "understand" and compare different text passages based on their contextual similarity.

## 🧮 Embedding Visualization

Once embeddings are generated, the next step is to store and organize them for efficient retrieval. This is where **vector databases** come into play. A vector database allows us to store and query embeddings, facilitating fast and relevant retrieval of documents based on their vector representation. Essentially, it serves as a bridge between raw data and actionable insights derived from large language models (LLMs). For this module, we’ll use **FAISS**.

## ⚙️ Powering RAG with Amazon Bedrock

With the foundation of embeddings and vector databases in place, we are ready to implement the RAG workflow using **Amazon Bedrock**. This section demonstrates how to use large language models to process input queries, retrieve relevant document embeddings from a vector database, and generate coherent, contextually appropriate responses using LLMs. We’ll also leverage **LangChain**, a framework designed to simplify building LLM-powered applications.

## 🧪 Exercise 1: Getting Started with RAG

Open `rag_examples/base_rag.py`. Let’s walk through the code to see how RAG works.

We start with a list of example sentences (line 15):

```python
sentences = [
    # Pets
    "Your dog is so cute.",
    "How cute your dog is!",
    "You have such a cute dog!",
    # Cities in the US
    "New York City is the place where I work.",
    "I work in New York City.",
    # Color
    "What color do you like the most?",
    "What is your favorite color?",
]
```

🔧 Now let's look at the implementation of the RAG workflow in ```rag_with_bedrock``` (line 60)

1. **Create Bedrock Embeddings**
 We initialize the embedding function by calling **BedrockEmbeddings**.
 We're using the Amazon Titan text embedding model to convert text into a vector format for similarity comparison.

```python
embeddings = BedrockEmbeddings(
    client=bedrock_runtime,
    model_id="amazon.titan-embed-text-v1",
)
```

2. **Vector Search with FAISS**
We create a local vector store using FAISS.from_texts, which indexes the sentence embeddings
into a searchable vector database. We can then vectorize a query and retrieve similar documents.

```python
local_vector_store = FAISS.from_texts(sentences, embeddings)
docs = local_vector_store.similarity_search(query)
```

3. **Calling the RAG Prompt**: We compile the content of the retrieved documents to form a context string. We then create a prompt that includes the context and the query. Finally, we call the call_claude function with our prompt get our answer.

```python
for doc in docs:
    context += doc.page_content

prompt = f"""Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

{context}

Question: {query}
Answer:"""

model_id = "us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0"
system_prompts = [{"text": "You are a helpful AI"}]
message_1 = {
    "role": "user",
    "content": [{"text": f"{prompt}"}],
}
messages = [message_1]

result = generate_conversation(model_id, system_prompts, messages)
return result
```
▶️ To test the code, run:

- `python3 rag_examples/base_rag.py`

🧪 Try changing the query at line 109. For example:
- try `What city do I work in?`

## 📄 Exercise 2: Chat with a PDF
There is also an example of how you chat with a PDF. Inside `rag_examples/chat_with_pdf.py` we have the `chunk_doc_to_text` function that will ingest the PDF and chunk every 1000 characters to store in the vector database. This process can take a while depending on the server, so we have already chunked the data which is stored in the folder `local_index`.

📚 In this example we stored all the text from the [AWS Well Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html) which highlights best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable systems in the cloud.

▶️ Now try running the code by entering the following command in the Terminal and pressing enter:

```bash
python3 rag_examples/chat_with_pdf.py
```

🔍 You can change the query on line 123. Play around to see how the model is able to use the context to figure out the correct answer. For example try:
- `What are some good use cases for non-SQL databases?`
- `What is the Well-Architected Framework?`
- `How can I improve security in the cloud?`

💡 You can even try off-topic questions such as `what are popular ice cream flavors` to see how the model handles questions outside the context.

## 🏁 Wrap up

🎉 Now that you have gotten a taste of using Amazon Bedrock for RAG, let's explore how we can create scalable RAG workflows.
